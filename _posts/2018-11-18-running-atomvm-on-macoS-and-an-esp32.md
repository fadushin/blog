In my <a href="/2018/11/why-erlang-is-relevant-to-iot/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">previous blog post</a>, I tried to explain why the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BEAM_(Erlang_virtual_machine)" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Erlang/OTP BEAM</a> (and specifically, <a href="https://github.com/bettio/AtomVM" target="_blank" rel="noopener">AtomVM</a>) is a compelling platform for development on micro-controllers. If you've made it to this page, I might have convinced you, or you might be here because you, too, have an interest in running <a href="http://www.erlang.org" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Erlang</a> or <a href="https://elixir-lang.org" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Elixer</a> programs on cheap embedded devices.

In this blog post, I want to show how to set up a development environment on MacOS, so that you can build and test AtomVM on your Mac. In addition, we include steps for connecting to an ESP32 device, and flashing the device with the AtomVM runtime and the "Hello World" of the IoT world, blinky.

<strong>What is AtomVM?</strong>

Let's start with an understanding of AtomVM.

AtomVM is a "virtual machine" (what used to be called an abstract machine, in functional and logic programming circles), capable of executing a subset of the BEAM instruction set.

The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BEAM_(Erlang_virtual_machine)" target="_blank" rel="noopener">BEAM</a> (short for "Bj√∂rn's Erlang Abstract Machine") was designed primarily to implement programs that were written in the Erlang programming language, though more recently, additional languages have been designed to target the same instruction set (such as Elixer, and Lisp Flavored Erlang, or LFE). This is analogous to how programming languages like Scala, Clojure, and Groovy target the Java Virtual machine (JVM). If you are interested in the BEAM, the <a href="https://happi.github.io/theBeamBook/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Erlang Runtime System</a> book is a very useful and informative reference.

AtomVM can be compiled to run on a Linux or MacOS machine (similar to how Micropython can run on UNIX machines). Having AtomVM run on a desktop of laptop can be very useful for debugging, as there are typically better tools for analyzing the runtime characteristics of the system.

AtomVM can also be cross-compiled for micro-controller architectures, and currently, the one supported architecture is the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tensilica" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Xtensa 32-bit LX6</a> microprocessor, available on the <a href="https://www.espressif.com/en/products/hardware/esp32/overview" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Espressif ESP32</a> integrated system on a chip (SoC).

One of the most exciting features of the ESP SoCs (ESP8266 and ESP32) is the board's on-board integration with 802.11 and bluetooth networking, making them applicable to "Internet of Things" (IoT) applications. For example, these devices are small and draw (relatively) little power, so they are ideal for integration into home and industrial wireless applications. The devices are also relatively cheap and accessible to hobbyists and enthusiasts, with fully integrated development boards costing less than $10.

These instructions will cover building AtomVM for <em>both</em> MacOS and the ESP32.


<strong>Hardware</strong>

Presumably the reason you are interested in AtomVM is that you want to run a Erlang code on a micro controller, like the ESP32.

ESp32 boards can be found on Ali Express for around $3.00, and if you are feeling adventurous, you can buy an ESP32 board, solder it up to an ESP32 adapter board, plug into a bread board, figure out where to place all the required resistors and capacitors, and wire it up to a UART serial controller of your choice. I have <a href="http://blog.dushin.net/2016/07/getting-started-with-esp8266-development-on-the-mac/">done that</a> with ESP8266 boards, and it has been a useful learning experience. However, for the purposes of this blog, I am using a fully integrated development board, which includes the USB serial adapter. The cost is only a few dollars more, and for <em>development</em>, this is an acceptable way to go. (You might decide to build your own circuit boards with basic ESP32 boards, if you ever bring your application into production, but we are a ways away from that!)

I found a decent development board on Amazon (the HiLetgo ESP-WROOM-32), for around $11. I could do better on Ali Express, but this board comes with the Silicon Labs CP2102 UART controller, for which I already have the driver installed on my machine. For instructions about locating and installing the driver for this chip set, see the instructions <a href="http://blog.dushin.net/2016/07/getting-started-with-esp8266-development-on-the-mac/">here</a>.

With this development board, a micro-USB cable, and the Silicon Labs driver for the CP2102 serial adapter, you are good to go.


<strong>Building AtomVM for Unix-like Operating Sytems</strong>

Building AtomVM on a desktop or laptop is a useful starting point, as it can be helpful to debug or test you application first on a MacOS, FreeBSD, or Linux machine, and then "flash" it (i.e., upload) to an ESP dev board.

So let's start with building AtomVM on a Mac. Most of the instructions (except for locating and installing prerequisite software) should be the same for FreeBSD or Linux. Consult your local documentation for details.

On MacOS, you will need a few pieces of software to get off the ground.

* <a href="https://developer.apple.com/xcode/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Xcode</a>
* <a href="https://brew.sh" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Homebrew</a>

Follow the instructions on the above web sites for installing these components, if you don't already have them installed.
<blockquote>Linux and FreeBSD users should already have a compiler and package manager on your machines, so the above steps should not be needed on those platforms.</blockquote>
Once you have home-brew installed, you can install a few additional components.

Start by installing <code>cmake</code>, the meta-build system


<pre><code>shell$ brew install cmake</code></pre>

You will also need <code>gperf</code>:

<pre><code>shell$ brew install gperf</code></pre>

If you don't already have <code>git</code>, you should also install it:

<pre>code>shell$ brew install git</code></pre>

Currently, AtomVM only supports Erlang modules compiled under Erlang R20. You can install R20 via brew, as well:

<pre><code>shell$ brew install erlang@20</code></pre>

You can then put this version of Erlang on your PATH, in case you already have a version of Erlang installed on your machine:

<code>shell$ export PATH="/usr/local/opt/erlang@20/bin:$PATH"</code>


<strong>Build AtomVM</strong>

The AtomVM project can be found on GitHub. Find a suitable location on your disk,

<code>shell$ git clone https://github.com/bettio/AtomVM
...</code>

You can now build AtomVM. The instructions should be the same for all UNIX-like operating systems.

<pre><code>shell$ cd AtomVM
shell$ mkdir build
shell$ cd build
shell$ cmake ..

-- Found ZLIB: /usr/lib/libz.dylib (found version "1.2.11")
-- Configuring done
-- Generating done
-- Build files have been written to: /work/src/github/fadushin/AtomVM/build
</code></pre>

This will generate make files for your project, and all build artifacts, including the AtomVM executable, will be created under your <code>build</code> directory.
<blockquote>Note that CMake will keep your source and build artifacts separate (except currently for some compiled Erlang tests and examples. You will find all of the AtomVM executables under the <code>build</code> directory (or wherever you ran <code>cmake</code> from).</blockquote>
You can now run <code>make</code>:

<pre><code>shell$ make
Scanning dependencies of target generated
[  1%] Hashing /work/src/github/fadushin/AtomVM/src/libAtomVM/bifs.gperf
[  1%] Built target generated
Scanning dependencies of target generated-nifs-hash

[  4%] Building C object src/libAtomVM/CMakeFiles/libAtomVM.dir/bif.c.o
[  4%] Building C object src/libAtomVM/CMakeFiles/libAtomVM.dir/context.c.o
...</code></pre>

If this ran cleanly, then congratulations! You now have AtomVM built on your machine!


<strong>Run AtomVM Tests</strong>

You can run the tests by running the <code>test-erlang</code> program in the <code>tests</code> directory:

<pre><code>shell$ tests/test-erlang
Seed is 1542509601
-- EXECUTING TEST: add.beam
-- EXECUTING TEST: fact.beam
-- EXECUTING TEST: mutrec.beam
-- EXECUTING TEST: morelabels.beam
-- EXECUTING TEST: biggerintegers.beam
-- EXECUTING TEST: biggerdifference.beam
-- EXECUTING TEST: moreintegertests.beam
-- EXECUTING TEST: send_receive.beam
...
-- EXECUTING TEST: complex_struct_size0.beam
-- EXECUTING TEST: complex_struct_size4.beam
-- EXECUTING TEST: make_garbage0.beam
-- EXECUTING TEST: make_garbage3.beam
-- EXECUTING TEST: make_garbage6.beam
-- EXECUTING TEST: make_garbage7.beam
-- EXECUTING TEST: copy_terms7.beam
-- EXECUTING TEST: copy_terms8.beam
</code></pre>

This should give you confidence that AtomVM is running well on your platform.


<strong>Run <code>hello_world!</code></strong>

You can also run a simple "hello world" program that has been built for you as part of the build process.  This program is quite simple.  It uses the console module to print "Hello World" to the screen:

<pre><code>
-module (hello_world).
-export([start/0]).

start() ->
    console:puts("Hello World\n").
</code></pre>

This program requires the <code>console</code> module, which is part of the <code>eavmlib</code> library.  This library gets automatically added to the <code>hello_world.avm</code> AVM file, when you build AtomVM.

You can run this program as an argument to the AtomVM program:

<pre><code>shell$ src/AtomVM examples/erlang/hello_world.avm
Hello World
Return value: 28b</code></pre>

Congratulations! You have just run your first Erlang program on AtomVM (albeit on a personal computer, not on a micro-controller -- yet).


<strong>AtomVM on an ESP32</strong>

Running AtomVM on an ESP32 is slightly more involved. We need to install a bit more software to compile the runtime system for the device, as the C code that forms the AtomVM virtual machine needs to be cross-compiled to the instruction set for the Xtensa 32-bit LX6 architecture.

In essence, we need two things:
<ol>
 	<li>The Xtensa compiler (or tool chain)</li>
 	<li>The <a href="https://docs.espressif.com/projects/esp-idf/en/v3.1.1/get-started/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Espressif IoT Development Framework</a> (or ESP-IDF)</li>
</ol>
Let's start with the compiler and tool chain. You can find links for pre-built binaries of the tool chain for MacOS and Linux (and even Windows!) <a href="https://docs.espressif.com/projects/esp-idf/en/v3.1.1/get-started/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here</a>. (I used <a href="https://dl.espressif.com/dl/xtensa-esp32-elf-osx-1.22.0-80-g6c4433a-5.2.0.tar.gz">this version</a>.)

Unpack this compressed tar ball and place it in a well-known location (I used <code>/work/opt</code>, but that's just me.). The archive should unpack into a directory called <code>xtensa-esp32-elf</code>.

You should set your PATH environment variable to include the bin directory of this package, e.g.,

<pre><code>shell$ xtensa_esp32_home=/work/opt/xtensa-esp32-elf/
shell$ PATH=${xtensa_esp32_home}/bin:$PATH
shell$ export PATH</code></pre>

You should now have the Xtensa compiler tool chain in your PATH environment variable, which will allow the build system to locate the compiler and linker tools needed to build AtomVM for the ESP32.

Next, we need the ESP-IDF framework, the base libraries that AtomVM needs to interface with the ESP32 hardware. You can think of this as like the ESP32 operating system.

You can find the latest version of the framework on the Espressif ESP-IDF <a href="https://github.com/espressif/esp-idf/releases" target="_blank" rel="noopener">releases</a> page on Github. I am currently using version 3.1.1.

This ZIP file should unpack into a directory, which you should also place in a well-known location. (I also used <code>/work/opt</code>).

You should set your <code>IDF_PATH</code> environment variable to the root location of this package, e.g.,

<code>shell$ IDF_PATH=/work/opt/esp-idf-v3.1.1
shell% export IDF_PATH</code>

Note. The AtomVM build system uses the <code>IDF_PATH</code> environment variable to locate common make files and source code for the ESP32. You should not need this environment variable outside of the context of this build.

Finally, if you are on MacOS, you need to have <code>gmake</code> installed on your machine, as some of the make files use idioms only supported on GNU Make, which are not supported on the version of Make that ships with Xcode.

<pre><code>shell$ brew install gmake</code></pre>


<strong>Building AtomVM for the ESP32</strong>

With the Xtensa toolchain and ESP-IDF installed, you should now be able to build AtomVM for the ESP32.

Note that unlike the build for MacOS, FreeBSD, or Linux, the build for the ESP32 requires that you enter the actual source directory under the directory under which you cloned the AtomVM source code (hereafter, <code>atom-vm-src-dir</code>).

You should now be able to build the ESP32 source code using <code>gmake</code>:
<blockquote><strong>Note.</strong> This will build a substantial amount of source code.</blockquote>

<pre><code>shell$ cd atom-vm-src-dir/src/platforms/esp32
shell$ gmake

Congratulations! You have now build the AtomVM virtual machine for the ESP32.

<strong>Flashing the ESP32</strong>

The last few lines of the above gmake run suggest how to flash AtomVM to your ESP32. However, this is just a suggestion, and we need to make a slight modification to your build configuration to flash to the proper serial device.

Fortunately, the build system makes this pretty easy. If you run the menuconfig target to Make, it will bring up a curses-style interface, which you can use to configure the flasher:

<pre><code>shell$ gmake menuconfig</code></pre>

![Make MenuConfig 1](/assets/images/make-menuconfig-1.png)

Select the Serial flasher config menu item, and you can configure the serial port:

![Make MenuConfig 2](/assets/images/make-menuconfig-2.png)

My Mac attaches to <code>/dev/tty.SLAB_USBtoUART</code>:

![Make MenuConfig 3](/assets/images/make-menuconfig-3.png)

Accept the changes, and exit the menu configuration interface.

You should then be able to run the flash target to Make:

<pre><code>shell$ gmake flash

Congratulations! You should now have the base AtomVM image uploaded to your ESP32.


<strong>Flashing Blinky</strong>

Okay, now for the moment of truth. We want to install an actual Erlang program onto the device, and for that, what better program than the "Hello World" of the IoT universe, <code>blinky</code>. This little program (<code>blink.erl</code>), which you can find <code>under atom-vm-src-dir/ examples/erlang/esp32</code>.

I'll talk more about this program in a subsequent blog post, but for now, you can simply move on to flashing and running it, as it is built for you as part of the AtomVM build.

You can flash the packed AVM file to your ESP32, starting at an offset of <code>0x110000</code> using the ESPtool, which is installed with your ESP-IDF framework:

<pre><code>shell$ $IDF_PATH/components/esptool_py/esptool/esptool.py --chip esp32 --port /dev/tty.SLAB_USBtoUART --baud 115200 --before default_reset --after hard_reset write_flash -u --flash_mode dio --flash_freq 40m --flash_size detect  0x110000 examples/erlang/esp32/blink.avm

At this point, you should see the on-board LED on pin 2 (usually blue) on your ESP32 device go on for a second, and then off for a second, in a loop. If it is, congratulations! You have run your first Erlang program on an ESP32 device!

<strong>Monitoring your ESP32</strong>

You can monitor any console output on your ESP32 via the monitor target to make (from the <code>atom-vm-src-dir/src/platforms/esp32</code> directory):

<pre><code>shell$ cd atom-vm-src-dir/src/platforms/esp32
shell$ gmake monitor

---</code></pre>

Any output should occur after the <code>---</code>. You can exit monitoring by pressing <code>ctl-]</code>.

That's it for now! Next time, we'll dig in a little deeper into Erlang programs under AtomVM.

<strong>Bonus</strong>

If you want to run AtomVM in a powerful debugger, you can do so very easily with <code>cmake</code>.  Just specify the Xcode generator when running CMake, and instead of Make files, you'll get an Xcode project, which you can open and run.

<pre>
shell$ cd path-to-atomvm-repo
shell$ mkdir xcode
shell$ cd xcode
shell$ cmake -G Xcode ..

</pre>

You can then open the project file (<code>AtomVM.xcodeproj</code>) on the command line, or via double click in the Finder.

To run AtomVM in the debugger, choose the AtomVM scheme in the target drop down menu:

![XCode 1](/assets/images/xcode-1.png)

Select "Edit Scheme" in the same target drop down menu, and enter the path to the <code>hello_world.beam</code> file that you built above.

![XCode 2](/assets/images/xcode-2.png)

Open the <code>main.c</code> source code module in the AtomVM project.  Put a breakpoint at the start of the program, and hit the run button.  You can now step through the AtomVM runtime.
