Lost+Found was the name of a radio show I did back in Syracuse, NY.  It was a pretty eclectic mix of rock, jazz, and other weird music most people have a hard time listening to.

`/lost+found` is also the directory used to store files recovered after an fsck on Linux systems.  I like what the docs say:

> The files recovered are not likely to be complete or make much sense but there always is a chance that something worthwhile is recovered.

Not unlike this blog.
